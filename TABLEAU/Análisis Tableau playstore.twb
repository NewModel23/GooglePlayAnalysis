Not really good presets also tweak around make binaural beats even little guide whenyou make helps know whatyou&apos;re kind effect likely have. I find genius better I searched for. I&apos;m also commending developers making ads non intrusive tastefully placed. This somethingI&apos;ve trying find years I started using binaural originally starting YouTube computer programs like audacity. You&apos;ll notice beats real legitimate listen headphone constant sound. If take find bud making best technically binaural beatbecause binaural beats made speakers brain gets confused two different tones played creates beat trying listen understandthem time. I apologize dysfunctional spacing comment. There&apos;s minor coding issue phone always automatically space proper times far there&apos;s update fix yet way annoying fix myself. I digress.

This worsened photo viewing limit, meaning may 2 versions photo, profile picture version full version, potentially wasting someone&apos;s free full-size photo viewings - Weird non-blanket hate speech policy (only specific groups protected hate speech, everyone site, despite \&quot;safer space everyone\&quot;), fine unless susceptible negative reprocussions online harassment (lowered self-esteem, depression, suicidal thoughts, etc) All decent app. Hope gets improved!&quot;</bucket>

I&apos;d like see $12 cash back turn $20- 20-$50-50-$100 etc account. .This banking experience good far. It suck organizations consider real bank listed bank. I ended cancelling Wells Fargo account bank America account I happy GoBank free little fees. Then I realized I able continue stocks investments via stash GoBank listed bank. So I money sitting stock I cant move add funds sucks. So I&apos;m keeping GoBank moment I find similar allows continue stocks I may make switch. I may keep bills new funding investments personal spending. I wish GoBank considered real bank businesses/society etc. Especially comes Stash app.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I love game. The animation super awesome, And graphics surprisingly amazing mobile. It&apos;s super adorable too! Definitely best mobile games there. The fighting system super simple tutorials makes even fun easy use. At times kinda wish game gave bit challenge beginning. Sometimes &apos;chapters&apos; (missions storyline idk called) easy. Leaving kinda bored continously fighting weaker enemies till \&quot;chapter&apos; 18 so. Normal mode felt like easy mode I like I change first time I played storyline. I also wish characters choose use. Not unlock characters different outfits different powers. So far four generic characters (personality wise, storyline aside). More characters would make game much fun! That&apos;s though, game great I highly recommend giving try.♡&quot;</bucket>

You&apos;ll probably get groove things long game lets free opens bunch additional, interesting stuff. Also, \&quot;open world\&quot; adventure bits get leveling bit pretty cool really showcase engine lot usual smaller battle arena main missions. tl;dr: cool, intro&apos;s bit long tutorial, there&apos;s stuff small battle arenas, go play&quot;</bucket>

Include 30 day ab challenge balance workouts. It leaves abs arms feeling like need yet legs tired start. The also gives enough audio info time get position great. Consider adding pilates yoga moves get well balanced full body workout.&quot;</bucket>

He&apos;s 5 YEARS OLD! I went ahead paid $10 dollars unlimited energy fair money enery deal I&apos;ve seen google play. Most games charge $10 refill energy. The guys DP satisfy developers well I see design definitely say came real pay-to-win scams there. I&apos;d give 10 stars I could great job guys DP developers creating game eat wallet super fun play.

              <bucket>&quot;I downloaded game I love basketball. I played basketball (Highschool), I still play basketball. My son 15 I taught play 2 1/2 yrs old. He&apos;d play shoulders. I created basketball addict. I&apos;ve Celtics fan whole life son carries love. We games matter simple always teach lesson. This game teaches patience timing everything. I think game could something. For example It ask favorite team beginning drafted team, (while getting pointers fave teams star(s), In case, Celtics pissibly Kyrie Irving) however would need get ?? level 25?? access buying official (NBA gear name voice number jersey, Celtics case). Then would need complete many missions order get annual salary, sign longer contracts, choose traded, etc...Just thought (feel free idea(s) copyrighted registered). However game still addictive, fun, passes time quickly. Great Job.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I love app. I third year using - first year free version, second year paid Premium version. WORTH EVERY PENNY! I&apos;m still learning take advantage features, game improves. Very accurate GPS shot placement, VERY accurate club recommendations. It guessed better many occasions I chose trust choice. It even adjusts recommendation elevation changes. The strokes gained feature great, statistics keeps. The l play, relevant features become, legitimately help improve game! A feature I&apos;d love see added practice/range mode. Some Disc Golf feature measure throws, allow mark position gps/satellite view, throw disc (or hit ball case) walk it, plot landing spot record distance. It helps track player progress, helps build disc (or club) history, accurate suggestions. One change I&apos;d like see improved hole numbering. If play nine holes 1-9, play front/back order, play course offers 27 holes, always labeled 1-9 1-18 app, even playing 10-18, 19-27, playing front/back order. It would nice see tracked number course, less confusing play, much much easier track looking back rounds later. Overall, EXCELLENT that&apos;s good free better paid Premium version.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;*TRIED THE TOP 5 DOCUMENT APPS, including this, AND FOUND THESE OUT* PRO(S): Compared similar apps, requires LEAST SPACE phone storage, good maintaining phone&apos;s speed. A file created also VERY SMALL SIZE. For example, size .doc file created 2.78 KB similar apps, .doc file become 6.30 14.50 KB size. CON(S): It can&apos;t export file .pdf file, I think. Also, pretty bad design, particularly creating/editing .ppt files; &apos;user-unfriendly&apos; even word. Nevertheless, I say pretty good thank devs I hope still improve app.&quot;</bucket>

I spent RIDICULOUS parts stability weight surpress cars flipping out, avail, car still same. Now glitch car STOPS DEAD, DEAD IN THE ROAD! I lost many many many races result glitch. There commentary devs fix sight. And heard excuses peeps made BS, glitch. Then boss level champion 3, good luck, npc much faster never beat him. Seems like good way keep peeps advancing unless PAY!! Also figured manipulate challengers. The game fun play figure works, makes wanna uninstall every session, dont invested money it, might well shut suck right!!

It offers lot technical details options compared VPNs. Limited number servers free version ones I&apos;ve connected fast enough despite continents. Finch also lists important details servers resources available. This helps user decide server use. The FAQ informative conpulsory reading all. The 3 GB quota generous enough. The fact registered Malaysia another attraction. I actually feel bad using free version. FinchVPN definitely worthy support.

              <bucket>&quot;great update. But update/new absolute garbage. It took 9 days get order shipped (haven&apos;t even received yet I ordered 11 days ago). Let alone shipped I bother Twitter. They said due \&quot;update system\&quot; coincides new app. Also, new layout sucks compared old. Way less intuitive, \&quot;shipping info\&quot; order shipped way less info order old app. Which makes absolutely sense. Before would tell xactly out. Now none that. Seriously, roll back old app. This trash. Base reviews I&apos;m alone. For company big, sold world... This absolutely unacceptable. If order door within days correct (since I see complaints wrong orders) I&apos;m deleting never shopping again.&quot;</bucket>

HOW MANY REQUESTS DO Y&apos;ALL NEED BEFORE YOU IMPLEMENT A DAMN DARK THEME?!!« Also, I can&apos;t help feel like lacking lot features make desktop version wonderful... For instance, ★Interface Personalization★. (I mean, call crazy I consider blindingly hideous white bar impossible-to-see-in-sunlight, thin grey font... aesthetically pleasing. It&apos;s actually rather ineffective. It&apos;s utilitarian depressing horrible.) Please explain personalize bejesus Chrome which, trapped home desktops, inconveniently stationary thus essentially useless (unless plan hella typing)... Yet comes single personal object carried virtually everyday, everyone, everywhere... An object become profoundly integral who/what ARE modern humans. An object, fosters us sense necessity, roughly 94\% Americans purportedly \&quot;cannot live without it\&quot;.... When we&apos;re considering single profoundly imperative aspect modern existence, smartphone, expectation us content half-assed, visually displeasing, minimalist, cookie-cutter interface, slapped existence with, undoubtedly minimal effort.. WHY?.. It&apos;s lazy, boring, ugly, (it&apos;s actually *not* weird ass place screen, I&apos;ll give y&apos;all that..) It&apos;s nevertheless distressing. And kinda insulting users pride unique, creative, individuals.. I digress. Back Interface —it&apos;s dumb force people method interacting product.— ★It&apos;s experience killer forced, along everyone else world, single, inefficient, uncomfortable rut!★.. —We&apos;re people, we&apos;re distinctly different, us. With different likes dislikes different views preferences want product, want experience feel.— There even \&quot;light\&quot; \&quot;dark\&quot; themes available. Which would simple solution. Or, better yet, Google: allow users express creating themes upload others apply. (similar desktop themes) This literally used, hideous entire phone. EVERYTHING else (that -isn&apos;t- Google app) least *offers* dark theme, pete&apos;s sake... like difficult. Hell, used navy grey-themed, whatever was.. +Dare I say, probably effort making damn white, would required simply inject \&quot;theme\&quot; option (disappointingly small) \&quot;settings\&quot; menu, users select two bubbles. Light Dark. Plenty users begging simple OPTIONS, —not forced changes, OPTIONAL CHOICES empower USER— quite time, now. Now, always M.O, Google.. company used user-centric, resource friendly apps, utilized simple easy UI felt natural made sense. Then y&apos;all started getting big britches. So, fire douchebag currently charge graphical user interfacing insists using worst possible interface aspects imaginable.

The train departed flo 20 minutes late supposed arrive 11:58 PM came station 3:49am came 4:26am criminal. Now daughter going train meet someone clock like next week NO CHECK. You think people r collecting would try fix that. But look reviews long delays. A working right giving real time updates times current status trains would make life much easier.

You also buy level packs, themes hints shop. Originally puzzle hints, started 3 way get free hints unless paid them. Thanks recent update, watch video ad earn free hint. Thanks! The themes alright honestly necessary pay unless care changing colours game. I personally bother these. Theres large amount free levels well premium level packs purchase around £1.50 pay price remove ads unlock (highly recommended). I however feel level packs offer green blue pack really pointless pay feel play like regular level pack. If going levels want people pay for, better offer something different something unique. Anyway great puzzle game, pick fun.&quot;</bucket>

After every Kindle update I check settings hoping they&apos;ve finally added SD storage option app. As yet, no. Original review: I good I bought comics. Even though I sd card storage used according screen Android, downloaded internal storage filled phone (several Star Wars comics). It seems option longer there.? I uninstalled comics &amp; figured I&apos;d new tablet I got. ...yeah. In section I even option. My Nook gives option &amp; I problem saving books B&amp;N sd card (if book allows it). I tried uninstall &amp; re-install Kindle, still save internal storage &amp; give sd/external storage option. On top that, let \&quot;rename device\&quot; name I I 1st tablet. I get \&quot;device taken\&quot;, wants rename device re-install (I uninstall 2nd time, &amp; 3rd remain way stupid thing fixed).

They subsequently billed second month without knowledge....now fun part...on purpose, whether online dashboard make cannot find cancel payment, subscription turn auto renew. On support section make sound like easy procedure I still yet tried find cancel even though I followed online instructions. They purpose make extremely difficult cancel subscription, cancel auto renew, edit payment details, hidden cannot find it. Additionally number rotate quickly get lot unwanted scam, spam &amp; texts eats minutes. A much waste money.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Decent enough app. Visual voicemail prior phone must built-in I never used get voicemail, new phone I to. I can&apos;t tap msg begins playing like old phone, opens another screen I tap start playback. Not deal breaker , little slower. I like msg transcription, msgs appear get transcribed understand pattern yet. Overall I like far. Don&apos;t care ui fonts Color scheme though. Seems dated rough.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Disigned simplicity best. As puzzles? Love them. Challenging. It&apos;s solving puzzle. So many puzzle games allow go back think try new routes. I love without making hard frustrating. Very well done! And coder interested constructive thoughts, (not even critism well done!) I one. I played puzzle game recently whenever solved puzzle uplifted comment would appear \&quot;Well done\&quot;, \&quot;Impressive\&quot; \&quot;You&apos;re right track\&quot;... It pretty neat. I personally NEED praise completing puzzles kept going even though I like aspects app... It oddly powerful factor keeping hooked app.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I got burnt putting trust Hopper predict best price trip Florida Banff, Canada. When I started using Hopper track flight prices trip, three months vacation, ample time give Hopper chance tell best prices would buy round trip flight. From day 1, Hopper told wait buy tickets anticipated prices would decrease much $130. So I waited... And waited... And waited... Hoping reap rewards patience strike perfect time score good deal flight. During time, I frustrated would notify everyday. In fact, post notifications. If I wanted update, I go time get it. However, towards end waiting period, Hopper updated started giving notifications, although daily frequency I desired, every 2-3 days. While I waited Hopper give good news, I watched anxious disappointment flight prices steadily increased Hopper continued tell wait. Then, weeks later flight prices increased $100, Hopper tells I stop waiting buy tickets anticipates prices increase point forward. Thanks nothing, Hopper. I really wanted work. It&apos;s great concept. However, developers need acquire flight data improve algorithms bunny going reach potential. Until then, I&apos;m wasting time money app. I trust can&apos;t recommend anyone, awful experience I it. Learn mistake.&quot;</bucket>
